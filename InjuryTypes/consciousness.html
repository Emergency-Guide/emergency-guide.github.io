      <p>If a person is unconscious or has a change in mental status, follow these first aid steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Call or tell someone to call 911</li>
        <li>Check the person's airway, breathing, and pulse frequently. If necessary, begin CPR</li>
        <li>If the person is breathing and lying on their back, and you do not think there is a spinal injury, carefully roll the person toward you onto their side. Bend the top leg so both hip and knee are at right angles. Gently tilt their head back to keep the airway open. If breathing or pulse stops at any time, roll the person onto their back and begin CPR</li>
        <li>If you think there is a spinal injury, leave the person where you found them (as long as breathing continues). If the person vomits, roll the entire body at one time to their side. Support their neck and back to keep the head and body in the same position while you roll</li>
        <li>Keep the person warm until medical help arrives</li>
        <li>If you see a person fainting, try to prevent a fall. Lay the person flat on the floor and raise their feet about 12 inches (30 centimeters)</li>
        <li>If fainting is likely due to low blood sugar, give the person something sweet to eat or drink when they become conscious</li>
      </ol>
      <p></p>
      <p>If the person is unconscious from choking:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Begin CPR. Chest compressions may help dislodge the object</li>
        <li>If you see something blocking the airway and it is loose, try to remove it. If the object is lodged in the person's throat, DO NOT try to grasp it. This can push the object farther into the airway</li>
        <li>Continue CPR and keep checking to see if the object is dislodged until medical help arrives</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <p>DO NOT:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>DO NOT give an unconscious person any food or drink</li>
        <li>DO NOT leave the person alone</li>
        <li>DO NOT place a pillow under the head of an unconscious person.</li>
        <li>DO NOT slap an unconscious person's face or splash water on their face to try to revive them.</li>
      </ul>
