      <p>A good way to find out if someone is confused is to ask the person his or her name, age, and the date. If they are unsure or answer incorrectly, they are confused. If the person does not usually have confusion, call a health care provider. A confused person should not be left alone. For safety, the person may need someone nearby to calm them and protect them from injury. Rarely, physical restraints may be ordered by a healthcare professional.<p>
      <p></p>
      <p>To help a confused person: </p>
      <p></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Always introduce yourself, no matter how well the person once knew you</li>
        <li>Often remind the person of his or her location</li>
        <li>Place a calendar and clock near the person</li>
        <li>Talk about current events and plans for the day</li>
        <li>Try to keep the surroundings calm, quiet, and peaceful</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <p>For sudden confusion due to low blood sugar (for example, from diabetes medicine), the person should drink a sweet drink or eat a sweet snack. If the confusion lasts longer than 10 minutes, call the provider.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Call 911 if the person if the person has suffered a head injury, or displays other symptoms such as cold or clammy skin, dizzines, fast pulse, fever, headache, shivering or slow/rapid breathing.</p>
