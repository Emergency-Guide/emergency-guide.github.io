          </div>
            </br>
            <p>Wherever you are when an earthquake starts, take cover immediately. Move a few steps to a nearby safe place if need be. Stay there until the shaking stops.</p>
            </br>


        <h2>If you are indoors: "DROP, COVER, HOLD ON"</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Stay inside.</li>
          <li><b>Drop</b> under heavy furniture such as a table, desk, bed or any solid furniture.</li>
          <li><b>Cover</b> your head and torso to prevent being hit by falling objects.</li>
          <li><b>Hold</b> onto the object that you are under so that you remain covered.</li>
          <li>If you can't get under something strong, or if you are in a hallway, flatten yourself or crouch against an interior wall.</li>
          <li>If you are in a shopping mall, go into the nearest store.</li>
          <li>Stay away from windows, and shelves with heavy objects.</li>
          <li>If you are at school, get under a desk or table and hold on. Face away from windows.</li>
          <li>If you are in a wheelchair, lock the wheels and protect the back of your head and neck.</li>
        </ul>

        </br>

        <h2>If you are outdoors:</h2>

        </br>

        <ul>
          <li>Stay outside.</li>
          <li>Go to an open area away from buildings.</li>
          <li>If you are in a crowded public place, take cover where you won't be trampled.</li>
        </ul>

       </br>

        <h2>If you are in a vehicle:</h2>

        </br>

        <ul>
          <li>Pull over to a safe place where you are not blocking the road. Keep roads clear for rescue and emergency vehicles.</li>
          <li>Avoid bridges, overpasses, underpasses, buildings or anything that could collapse.</li>
          <li>Stop the car and stay inside.</li>
          <li>Listen to your car radio for instructions from emergency officials.</li>
          <li>Do not attempt to get out of your car if downed power lines are across it. Wait to be rescued.</li>
          <li>Place a HELP sign in your window if you need assistance.</li>
          <li>If you are on a bus, stay in your seat until the bus stops. Take cover in a protected place. If you can't take cover, sit in a crouched position and protect your head from falling debris.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>AVOID the following in an earthquake:</h2>

        </br>

        <ul>
          <li>Doorways. Doors may slam shut and cause injuries.</li>
          <li>Windows, bookcases, tall furniture and light fixtures. You could be hurt by shattered glass or heavy objects.</li>
          <li>Elevators. If you are in an elevator during an earthquake, hit the button for every floor and get out as soon as you can.</li>
          <li>Downed power lines - stay at least 10 metres away to avoid injury.</li>
          <li>Coastline. Earthquakes can trigger large ocean waves called <a href="tsunami.html">tsunamis </a>.</li>
        </ul>
