        <ul>
          <li>Always check the marine forecast from the <a href="http://www.weatheroffice.gc.ca/marine/index_e.html">Weatheroffice</a> website before going boating and listen to weather reports during your cruise. Never go out in a boat during a storm. If you are on the water and you see bad weather approaching, head for shore immediately.</li>
          <li>Do not go down to the water to watch the storm. Most people who are killed during hurricanes are caught in large waves, storm surges or flood waters.</li>
          <li>If the eye of the hurricane passes over, there will be a lull in the wind lasting from two or three minutes to half an hour. Stay in a safe place. Make emergency repairs only and remember that once the eye has passed over, the winds will return from the opposite direction with possibly even greater force.</li>
          <li>Listen for reports from authorities on your portable radio.</li>
          <li>If lightning is present, remember that you can use a cellular telephone during a severe storm, but it's not safe to use a land-line telephone.</li>
          <li>On a farm, depending on your location and available shelter, it may be better to leave livestock unsheltered. During Hurricane Andrew, some horses left outside suffered less injury than those placed in shelters. This was because some shelters did not withstand the high winds. Horses were injured by collapsing structures and flying objects that may have been avoided on the outside.
