            <h2>What to do during a severe storm</h2>
            </br>
          </div>

        <ul>
          <li>If you are indoors, stay away from windows, doors and fireplaces.</li>
          <li>You may want to go to the sheltered area that you and your family chose for your emergency plan.</li>
          <li>If you are advised by officials to evacuate, do so. Take your emergency kit with you.</li>
          <li>You can use a cellular telephone during a severe storm, but it's not safe to use a land-line telephone.</li>
          <li>Never go out in a boat during a storm. If you are on the water and you see bad weather approaching, head for shore immediately. Always check the marine forecast before leaving for a day of boating and listen to weather reports during your cruise.</li>
          <li>If you are in a car, stop the car away from trees or power lines that might fall on you). Stay there.</li>
        </ul>

        </br>

        <h2>What to do during:</h2>

        </br>

        <h2>Blizzards</h2>

        </br>

        <ul>
          <li>When a winter storm hits, stay indoors. If you must go outside, dress for the weather. Outer clothing should be tightly woven and water-repellent. The jacket should have a hood. Wear mittens - they are warmer than gloves - and a hat, as large portion of body heat is lost through the head.</li>
          <li>In wide-open areas, visibility can be virtually zero during heavy blowing snow or a blizzard. You can easily lose your way. If a blizzard strikes, do not try to walk to another building unless there is a rope to guide you or something you can follow.</li>
          <li>If you must travel during a winter storm, do so during the day and let someone know your route and arrival time.</li>
          <li>If you start moving downward with the avalanche, stay on the surface using a swimming motion.</li>
          <li>If your car gets stuck in a blizzard or snowstorm, remain calm and stay in your car. Allow fresh air in your car by opening the window slightly on the sheltered side - away from the wind. You can run the car engine about 10 minutes every half-hour if the exhaust system is working well. Beware of exhaust fumes and check the exhaust pipe periodically to make sure it is not blocked with snow. Remember: you can't smell potentially fatal carbon monoxide fumes.</li>
          <li>To keep your hands and feet warm, exercise them periodically. In general, it is a good idea to keep moving to avoid falling asleep. If you do try to shovel the snow from around your car, avoid overexerting yourself.</li>
          <li>Overexertion in the bitter cold can cause death as a result of sweating or a heart attack.</li>
          <li>Keep watch for traffic or searchers.</li>
        </ul>

       </br>

        <h2>Hail</h2>

        </br>

        <ul>
          <li>Take cover when hail begins to fall. Do not go out to cover plants, cars or garden furniture or to rescue animals. Hail comes down at great speed, especially when accompanied by high winds. Although no one in Canada has ever been killed by hail, people have been seriously injured by it.</li>
          <li>When a hailstorm hits, stay indoors, and keep yourself and your pets away from windows, glass doors and skylights which can shatter if hit by hailstones. Avoid using the telephone during a storm, and do not touch metal objects like stoves, radiators, metal pipes, and sinks.</li>
          <li>When a hailstorm hits, find shelter and avoid underpasses or any low lying areas that may flood.</li>
        </ul>

        </br>

        <h2>Ice storms</h2>

        </br>

        <ul>
          <li>Ice from freezing rain accumulates on branches, power lines and buildings. If you must go outside when a significant amount of ice has accumulated, pay attention to branches or wires that could break due to the weight of the ice and fall on you. Ice sheets could also do the same.</li>
          <li>Never touch power lines. A hanging power line could be charged (live) and you would run the risk of electrocution. Remember also that ice, branches or power lines can continue to break and fall for several hours after the end of the precipitation.
</li>
          <li>When freezing rain is forecast, avoid driving. Even a small amount of freezing rain can make roads extremely slippery. Wait several hours after freezing rain ends so that road maintenance crews have enough time to spread sand or salt on icy roads.</li>
          <li>Rapid onsets of freezing rain combined with the risks of blizzards increase the chances for extreme hypothermia. If you live on a farm, move livestock promptly to shelter where feed is available. Forage is often temporarily inaccessible during and immediately after ice storms. Animal reactions to ice storms are similar to that of blizzards.
</li>
        </ul>

        </br>

        <h2>Lightning</h2>

        </br>

        <ul>
          <li>Always take shelter during a lightning storm.</li>
          <li>There is no safe place outside during a thunderstorm. Safe shelter can be found either in an enclosed building or a hard-topped vehicle.</li>
          <li>If you can see lightning or hear thunder, you are in danger of being hit. Seek shelter immediately.
</li>
          <li>Wait 30 minutes after the last lightning strike in a severe storm before venturing outside again.</li>
          <li>Do not ride bicycles, motorcycles, tractors, or golf carts. These will not protect you from a lightning strike.</li>
        </br>

      </br>

      <h2>Thunderstorms</h2>

      </br>

      <ul>
        <li>During thunderstorms, you should also stay away from items that conduct electricity, such as corded telephones, appliances, sinks, bathtubs, radiators and metal pipes.</li>
      </ul>
